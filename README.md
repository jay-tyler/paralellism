# parallelism
Learning to deal with parallelism and concurrency using Python.

Python has been my primary learning language, and as of the start of this repo, I'm not fully competent
when it comes to dealing with parallelism on a single machine. Some topics to explore:
* multi-processing
* multi-threading
* greenlets

Libraries to explore:
* Multithreading
* Multiprocessing
* Stackless Python

Any original work code is provided under the MIT license, but some code here will be mostly copied from free tutorial sources (this is a learning repo). I'll do my best to indicate appropriate per-file licensing at the head of each file.
