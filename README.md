# parallelism
Learning to deal with parallelism and concurrency using Python.

Python has been my primary learning language, and as of the start of this repo, I'm not fully competent
when it comes to dealing with parallelism on a single machine. Some topics to explore:
* multi-processing
* multi-threading
* greenlets

Libraries to explore:
* Multithreading
* Multiprocessing
* Stackless Python
